> # What is HOC
- Answer: Higher-order components (HOC) are a pattern in React for reusing component logic. An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. It allows you to add common behavior to multiple components.

01.  Reusability: HOCs allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components, which can save time and reduce code duplication.
02. Flexibility: HOCs can take additional arguments, which allows you to customize the behavior of the HOC. This makes them a flexible way to add functionality to your components.
03. Separation of concerns: HOCs can help separate concerns in your code by encapsulating certain functionality in a separate component. This can make the code easier to read and maintain.
04. Composition: HOCs can be composed together to create more complex functionality. This allows you to build up functionality from smaller, reusable pieces.
05. Higher-order components can be used to implement cross-cutting concerns in your application such as authentication, error handling, logging, performance tracking, and many other features.
