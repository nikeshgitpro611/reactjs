- Time Selection: Enabling users to pick a specific time. This can be used for applications that require time input, like scheduling meetings or setting reminders.

- Date Range Selection: Allowing users to select a range of dates. This is particularly useful for travel booking systems, project management tools, or any application where a start and end date are needed.

- Date and Time Selection: Providing a combined date and time picker for applications that need precise scheduling, like event planning or scheduling software.

- Localization and Formatting: Supporting various date and time formats and localization. This ensures that the date and time inputs are displayed in a way that is familiar to users from different regions.

# Grid
- Creates visual consistency between layouts while allowing flexibility across a wide variety of designs. Material Design's responsive UI is based on a 12-column grid layout.
- There are two types of layout: containers and items
- Item widths are set in percentages, so they're always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.
- There are five grid breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl.
# @mui/x-data-grid
